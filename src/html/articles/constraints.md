I need to get back to basic, to a time before frameworks and sass. But I also need 
to be current and explore new features of standard web technologies.

# Constraints 
* Plain CSS with
  * no use of media queries
  * no use of class names
* Vanilla TypeScript

# Criterion
* Responsive
* Accessable 
* Degrade to old browser without breaking readability

# Plain CSS

## No use of media queries
Fluid layout, use new vw and flexbox 

## No use of class names
Explore css selectors and scaffolding in more depth

# Vanilla TypeScript
But you will need a framework for this. Yes, but I need to practice 
TypeScript. I need to understand better how JavaScript in the browser
works without any frameworks.

After speaking to Martin I propose using Wordpress for content 
management and a static site generator to create the site. 

This means Wordpress will operate as a headless cms and the static 
site generator will extract the content when building the site. 

This gives us the best of two worlds: an editing interface the content 
managers are familiar with, and a public-facing static site.

Static sites are much faster and more secure than an average 
Wordpress installation. Read more about it in Smashing Magazine: 
[Why Static Website Generators Are The Next Big Thing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/).

I have some experience with the static site generator Metalsmith and Jekyll,
but it might be worth looking into a React based generator as Kahoot has this competency in-house.

My academic background is a Master of Computer Science from the Norwegian University 
of Science and Technology. I graduated in 2009 and have been working in the app and web space since then. 

I have used Wordpress when in need of a cms for more than 10 years.

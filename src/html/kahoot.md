After speaking to Martin I propose using Wordpress as a headless cms for content management.
The content is then extracted using the Wordpress REST Api and a website created using a
static generator. These websites are much faster and more secure 
than an average Wordpress installation. Read more about it in Smashing
Magazine: [Why Static Website Generators Are The Next Big Thing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/).

I have some experience with both Metalsmith and Jekyll as a static generator, 
but it might be worth looking into one based on React since Kahoot has this competency in-house.

My academic background is a Master of Computer Science from the Norwegian University
 of Science and Technology. I graduated in 2009 and have been working in the app and web space since then. 

I have used Wordpress for different projects for more than 10 years and developed both native and hybrid apps.

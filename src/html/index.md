My name is Benedicte Raae and I am a freelance web developer living in Oslo, Norway.

**I code apps and websites.**

Currently, I use Ionic 2, Angular2 and Metalsmith as my main tools. But I would love to 
tackle any projects taking the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) approach. 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/raae), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/raae), 
[LinkedIn](https://no.linkedin.com/in/benedicteraae) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/benedicteraae).

After completing my MSc in Computer Sciene in 2009 I have done [all kinds of projects](/portfolio) 
in and around the web space. In many of the projects, I have been responsible for 
both concept and execution in addition to marketing.

My New Years's resolution for 2017 is to get a developer blog going. Any day now there will be
movement over in the [blog section](/blog).

bGraphic.no has been my home on the Interwebz since 2006. It is a tribute to my childhood's 
dream to be a graphic designer.

My technical goal for this site is to go back to basic. No use of CSS or JS frameworks. 
I have not needed JavaScript yet, but when I do it will be of the vanilla flavour.

At the same time it is modern take on a basic website by using the Static Generator Metalsmith
and the templating language Jade.

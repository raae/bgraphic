The technical goal for this site (bgraphic.no) has been to go back to basic. No use of CSS or JS frameworks. 
JavaScript have not been needed yet, but when I do it will be of the vanilla flavour.

To create the site I went for the modern take on static websites by using a static site generator. 
I choose Metalsmith because it is written in JavaScript and seem able to do more than generate 
standard blogs and websites.

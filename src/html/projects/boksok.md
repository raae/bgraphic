Boksøk is directory of accesible books from the non-profit Leser søker bok (LSB). 

The main purpose of this project in 2014 was to make it easier for editors to add books. The solution: 
Migrate from an old non-standard cms to Wordpress (WP) with the use of Advances Custom Fields.

The editors were already familiar with WP and have been happily adding books since the launch in early 2015.

Twitter Bootstrap was used with little customization for the front-end.

Currently, the mission is to make the directory better for people with dyslexia. 
This is being done by using Algolia for search and using a non-white background.
